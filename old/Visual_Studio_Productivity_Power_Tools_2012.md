Although [Resharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) is my favorite extension for Visual Studio it lacks of a few useful futures.  
Therefore I installed the [Productivity Power Tools 2012](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3a96a4dc-ba9c-4589-92c5-640e07332afd) which comes with some really cool enhancements for Visual Studio.

The things I use:

##### Enhanced Scroll Bar
Shows breakpoints, file changes, cursor position, find result and matching words under the cursor in the scroll bar as well as a complete code preview (minimap) which can be zoomed by putting the mouse over it.
##### Column Guides
Allows to draw vertical lines in code which is helpful to remind myself not to write lines of code which are thousands of characters long.  
##### Colored Tabs
Colorizes the tabs in Visual Studio based on the file's project or regular expressions.
